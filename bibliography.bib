  abstract = {District energy systems can potentially decrease the CO2 emissions linked to energy services, thanks to the implementation of large polygeneration energy conversion technologies connected to buildings over a network. To transfer the energy from these large technologies to the users, conventional district energy systems use water with often two independent supply and return piping systems for heat and cold. However, sharing energy or interacting with decentralised heat pump units often results in relatively large heat transfer exergy losses due to the large temperature differences that are economically required from the water network. Besides, the implementation of two independent supply and return piping systems for heat and cold, results in large space requirements in underground technical galleries. Using refrigerants as a district heating or cooling fluid at an intermediate temperature could alleviate some of these drawbacks. A new system has been developed, that requires only two pipes, filled with refrigerant, to meet heating, hot water and cooling requirements. Because of the environmental concerns about conventional refrigerants, CO2, a natural refrigerant, used under its critical point, is considered an interesting candidate. A comparative analysis shows that both in terms of exergy efficiency and costs the proposed CO2 network is favourable.},

  abstract = {A new type of district energy network providing simultaneously heating and cooling services is being investigated. It is based on the use of CO2 as a heat transfer fluid by taking advantage of the latent heat of vaporization, to store and transfer heat across the network. The goal of the present study is to determine the performance of a CO2 network when applied to a real urban area. It focuses first on determining the requirements for the various thermal energy services for a part of Geneva's City Centre. The final energy consumption is first computed for the energy conversion technologies now in place in this area \textendash{} namely heating oil boilers and air cooled compression chillers. Then the new final energy consumption is computed considering that a CO2 network is used instead of boilers and air cooled compression chillers. For the area considered the CO2 network's variant leads to a final energy consumption of 10,968~MWh of electricity. It represents a reduction of 84.4\% when compared to the boilers and chillers case. A comparative profitability analysis of the two cases is also presented. The analysis takes into account investment, heating oil and/or electricity, equipment replacement, operation, and maintenance costs, as well as the sales of energy services. For an interest rate of 6\%, a price of the delivered heating/cooling services at 0.108 \texteuro{}~kW~h-1 and a lifetime of 40 years, the conventional technology does not reach profitability while the CO2 network achieves a profit in present value of 69.59 million \texteuro{} and the break-even point is reached after 5.5 years of operation.},

The presented results are based on a detailed monitoring campaign, covering a full year of operation, in real use conditions. After presenting the system concept, the system performance is analyzed by way of a detailed Sankey diagram (heat and electricity flows between the various production units, heat storages, and demand units), along with specific analysis of the diverse sub-systems. As a complement to the monitoring results, we present a simulation tool that was specifically developed for this type of application, and its validation against monitoring data, in terms of annual values and monthly profiles of the diverse energy flows.},
