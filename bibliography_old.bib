  abstract = {District energy systems can potentially decrease the CO2 emissions linked to energy services, thanks to the implementation of large polygeneration energy conversion technologies connected to buildings over a network. To transfer the energy from these large technologies to the users, conventional district energy systems use water with often two independent supply and return piping systems for heat and cold. However, sharing energy or interacting with decentralised heat pump units often results in relatively large heat transfer exergy losses due to the large temperature differences that are economically required from the water network. Besides, the implementation of two independent supply and return piping systems for heat and cold, results in large space requirements in underground technical galleries. Using refrigerants as a district heating or cooling fluid at an intermediate temperature could alleviate some of these drawbacks. A new system has been developed, that requires only two pipes, filled with refrigerant, to meet heating, hot water and cooling requirements. Because of the environmental concerns about conventional refrigerants, CO2, a natural refrigerant, used under its critical point, is considered an interesting candidate. A comparative analysis shows that both in terms of exergy efficiency and costs the proposed CO2 network is favourable.},

  abstract = {A new type of district energy network providing simultaneously heating and cooling services is being investigated. It is based on the use of CO2 as a heat transfer fluid by taking advantage of the latent heat of vaporization, to store and transfer heat across the network. The goal of the present study is to determine the performance of a CO2 network when applied to a real urban area. It focuses first on determining the requirements for the various thermal energy services for a part of Geneva's City Centre. The final energy consumption is first computed for the energy conversion technologies now in place in this area \textendash{} namely heating oil boilers and air cooled compression chillers. Then the new final energy consumption is computed considering that a CO2 network is used instead of boilers and air cooled compression chillers. For the area considered the CO2 network's variant leads to a final energy consumption of 10,968~MWh of electricity. It represents a reduction of 84.4\% when compared to the boilers and chillers case. A comparative profitability analysis of the two cases is also presented. The analysis takes into account investment, heating oil and/or electricity, equipment replacement, operation, and maintenance costs, as well as the sales of energy services. For an interest rate of 6\%, a price of the delivered heating/cooling services at 0.108 \texteuro{}~kW~h-1 and a lifetime of 40 years, the conventional technology does not reach profitability while the CO2 network achieves a profit in present value of 69.59 million \texteuro{} and the break-even point is reached after 5.5 years of operation.},

  abstract = {Compact district energy networks in a temperature range of 10 to 16$^\circ$C have a great potential for energy savings by providing a heat source for decentralized heating heat pumps, a cold source for air-conditioning and a heat sink for refrigeration or cogeneration units. The energy balance of the network is done by a central plant equipped with a heating heat pump for Winter operation and a heat dissipater for Summer operation. They typically facilitate the synergy between users and allow the concept of a city without chimneys or cooling towers in the various buildings. One such concept is based on using the latent heat of the transfer fluid (CO2),with one saturated CO2 vapor pipe and one saturated CO2 liquid pipe, in which the flow is bidirectional in the function of the predominance of the heating or cooling demands. While the concept has already been published this paper discusses some of the potential dynamic phenomena as well as further extension to allow those networks to collect CO2 from hybrid decentralized SOFC-GT cogeneration systems for either further disposal, use or contribution to power to gas concepts. Additional extensions to using reversible supercritical CO2 heat pump or ORC is also mentioned. A reminder of the technico-economic results obtained on the actual demands of an existing district is also done including the evaluation of the uncertainty margins.},

The objective for these strategies is to identify how the EU can reach its target of an 80\% reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 compared to 1990 levels. None of these scenarios involve the large-scale implementation of district heating, but instead they focus on the electrification of the heating sector (primarily using heat pumps) and/or the large-scale implementation of electricity and heat savings. In this paper, the potential for district heating in the EU between now and 2050 is identified, based on extensive and detailed mapping of the EU heat demand and various supply options. Subsequently, a new `district heating plus heat savings' scenario is technically and economically assessed from an energy systems perspective. The results indicate that with district heating, the EU energy system will be able to achieve the same reductions in primary energy supply and carbon dioxide emissions as the existing alternatives proposed. However, with district heating these goals can be achieved at a lower cost, with heating and cooling costs reduced by approximately 15\%.},

The operation principle and energy efficiency of a heat pump are defined first. Then, a general introduction on the GSHPs and its development, and a detailed description of the surface water (SWHP), ground-water (GWHP), and ground-couplet (GCHP) heat pumps are performed. The most typical simulation and ground thermal response test models for the vertical ground heat exchangers currently available are summarized including the heat transfer processes outside and inside the boreholes. Also, some information about a new GWHP using a heat exchanger with special construction, and the possibility to obtain the better energy efficiency with combined heating and cooling by GCHP are presented. The various hybrid GCHP systems for cooling or heating-dominated buildings are well described. Finally, the energy, economic and environmental performance of a closed-loop GCHP system is also briefly reviewed. It is found that the GSHP technology can be used both in cold and hot weather areas and the energy saving potential is significant.},

The GSHPs are proven renewable energy technology for space heating and cooling. This paper provides a detailed literature review of the GSHP systems, and their recent advances. The operation principle and energy efficiency of a heat pump are defined first. Then, a general introduction on the GSHPs and its development, and a detailed description of the surface water (SWHP), ground-water (GWHP), and ground-couplet (GCHP) heat pumps are performed. The most typical simulation and ground thermal response test models for the vertical ground heat exchangers currently available are summarized including the heat transfer processes outside and inside the boreholes. Also, some information about a new GWHP using a heat exchanger with special construction, and the possibility to obtain the better energy efficiency with combined heating and cooling by GCHP are presented. The various hybrid GCHP systems for cooling or heating-dominated buildings are well described. Finally, the energy, economic and environmental performance of a closed-loop GCHP system is also briefly reviewed. It is found that the GSHP technology can be used both in cold and hot weather areas and the energy saving potential is significant.},

  abstract = {A new avenue in modern heat pump technology is related to the use of natural refrigerants such as carbon dioxide (CO2). The use of CO2 in direct expansion ground source heat pumps (DX-GSHP) has also gained significant interest as it offers opportunities for cost reduction of the ground loop, albeit some challenges remain in their development, design and use. To address these challenges and to characterize CO2-DX-GSHP performance for water heating applications, a detailed theoretical model and a fully-instrumented test apparatus was developed and built at CanmetENERGY Research Laboratory. The theoretical model was validated against a set of experimental results and adopted to investigate the performance of the system over a wide operating range. Validation results showed that the model predicts the experimental results within the measurement uncertainty. A detailed system performance analysis was also performed using the theoretical model to understand the system behavior and explore the actions required for performance improvement in future installations. The results of the analysis showed that improper design and control of some components, such as the gas cooler and ground heat exchanger can degrade the system performance by up to 25\%, and the heat pump heating capacity by 7.5\%.},

The simulation results are found to be in good agreement with the results available in the literature. To analyze the performance characteristics of carbon dioxide in the ground-coupled evaporator, the parametric study focused on evaporator parameters including coil length, number of ground circuits and mean evaporation temperature. Also investigated is the relationship between gas cooler and evaporator sizing. Results indicate that there exists an optimum number of ground circuits which results in higher heating capacity and coefficient of performance. Performance can be further improved by optimizing the mean evaporation temperature with the surrounding soil temperature. With optimization, the system under study could achieve a coefficient of performance of 2.58, representing an 18\% improvement compared to the baseline system.},

  abstract = {In this study, a theoretical quasi-transient model is developed for detailed simulations of a carbon dioxide (CO2) direct-expansion ground source heat pump (DX-GSHP). This model combines a transient analytical model for the ground, steady-state numerical models for the borehole and the gas cooler, as well as several thermodynamic models for the remaining components of a conventional heat pump, organized in interacting subroutines to form a powerful simulation tool. Extensive validation combining experimental data and CFD-generated results was performed for the borehole before the tool was used to simulate a practical application case. Performance is investigated for a system satisfying both space heating and domestic hot water requirements of a typical single family detached home in a cold climate region. The variation of different system parameters is also evaluated in this study. It is shown that CO2 DX-GSHPs can offer relatively efficient and stable performance for integrated water and space heating applications. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate geothermal borehole sizing is highlighted for the DX-CO2 heat pump systems. It is shown that, due to changes in the system working conditions, the total borehole length is not linearly correlated with the heat pump energy consumption and other parameters such as heat pump coefficient of performance and pressure drop in ground heat exchangers. Results showed that increasing the total borehole length of an optimum design (reference case study) by 25\% decreases the total annual energy consumption by only 6\%. However, reducing total borehole length of the reference case by 25\% increases the total annual energy consumption by 10\%.},

For this purpose, a DX-GSHP and an SL-GCHP system are designed and installed in parallel for same space cooling load in a demonstrating building in Hunan province, China. The structures of the two systems are described. The performances of the two systems were experimentally determined from June to September in cooling season of 2009. The average cooling performance coefficients (PFsys) of the DX-GSHP system was obtained to be 6.03 and that of the SL-GCHP system was determined to be 5.64. The average input power values for the DX-GSHP system and the SL-GCHP system are found to be 1.39 and 1.715~kWh, respectively, which means that DX-GSHP has a 23.8\% higher efficiency than SL-GCHP in cooling mode. The paper studied the initial investment, the annual cost (AC) and the present worth (PW) of the two systems. It is concluded that the DX-GSHP is more economic than the SL-GCHP. Further more, the advantage and disadvantage of the DX-GSHP are analyzed. The minimal refrigerant velocity in order to ensure oil return is derived. It is shown that DX-GSHP could be vigorously pushed when oil return problem is solved satisfactorily.},

It firstly describes the development of a 3D coupled Finite Element Model (FEM), which is utilized to simulate the steady state and transient behaviors of geothermal heat exchanger (GHE). The model holistically couples the heat exchange processes between pipe fluid flow, grouting backfill material, and adjacent ground associated with GHE. The model is firstly validated by comparison with the experimental data from an in-service GHE. Base on the calibrated model, a series of sensitivity analyses are conducted on the influence of geological, design, and operational factors intermittent operation mode of GHE achieves higher such as the initial ground temperature profile, GHE pipe installation depth, circulation fluid flow velocity, inlet temperature, subsurface water flow velocity, and material thermal properties. It also assess the behaviors of GHE under continuous operation versus intermittent operation modes. The results show that both design parameter (i.e., GHE pipe installation depth) and operational parameters (i.e., circulation fluid flow velocity) have major influence on the GHE performance. For a certain design length of GHE, the GHE performance improves with higher circulation fluid flow velocity until beyond a critical velocity. For GHE working in the heating mode, the heat extraction by GHE increases with decreasing fluid temperature at the inlet. In the geological factor aspect, the thermal conductivity of the ground material plays a very important role on the GHE performance operating in the continuous operation mode, while its specific heat capacity exerts no appreciable influence. However, for intermittent operation mode, both thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity of the ground, particularly the grouting materials, affect the ground thermal energy extraction. The results also showed that the presence of subsurface ground water flow improves the heat exchange of GHE. Operation wise, the GHE achieves higher performance and Coefficient of Performance (COP) under intermittent operation mode than under continuous operation mode. These observations point to ways to improve the performance of GHE from both design and operation aspects.},

The test tube had an inner diameter of 4.57~mm, with a 0.89-mm wall thickness and length of 4.2~m. Experiments were carried out for heat fluxes ranging from 10 to 40~kW/m2~K, mass fluxes ranging from 200 to 1000kg/m2~s, and saturation temperatures ranging from 0 to 40~$^\circ$C. The boiling heat transfer of CO2 has a greater effect on nucleate boiling than convective boiling and highly depends on the vapor quality, heat flux, and saturation temperature. The boiling heat transfer coefficient of CO2 increases with a decrease in the inner tube diameter. In a comparison to previous boiling heat transfer correlations, the correlation of Cheng et~al. showed fairly good agreement with the experimental data for CO2. The boiling pressure drop of CO2 increased with an increase in the mass flux and decreased with an increase in the saturation temperature. None of the empirical correlations from the existing literature were able to predict the pressure drop of CO2 in good agreement with the experimental data. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a reliable and accurate prediction for estimating the boiling pressure drop of CO2.},

  abstract = {Compact and lightweight heat exchangers are needed for motor vehicle air-conditioning systems and for several types of unitary equipment. The high-pressure natural refrigerant CO2 is now being evaluated for use in such applications, and efficient heat exchangers are being developed and investigated. Carbon dioxide heat exchangers are designed for high refrigerant mass flux and use small-diameter tubes or extruded flat microchannel tubes. Refrigerant-side heat transfer coefficients are higher than with fluorocarbons, and reduced internal surface areas can therefore be tolerated. Both small-diameter mechanically expanded round-tube heat exchangers and brazed microchannel-type units have been built and tested successfully. Results show that compact heat exchangers optimized for CO2 are very competitive with baseline HFC/HCFC units in terms of physical dimensions, exchanger mass and thermal performance. Smaller tube and manifold dimensions can give reduced size compared with HFC-134a equipment. The temperature approach between air inlet and refrigerant outlet is much lower in CO2 gas coolers than in baseline system condensers of equal size and capacity, and the reduced refrigerant exit temperature has a marked influence on the coefficient of performance, Microchannel heat exchangers give the best overall efficiency. Refrigerant distribution in multiport manifolds and heat transfer tubes does not seem to be a problem.

Les coefficients de transfert de chaleur, c\^ot\'e frigorig\`ene, apparaissent plus importants que dans le cas de l'utilisation des fluorocarbures, ce qui permet de r\'eduire les surfaces internes. On a construit et test\'e avec succ\`es des \'echangeurs \`a tubes ronds de petit diam\`etre dilat\'es m\'ecaniquement, ainsi que des \'echangeurs munis de tubes bras\'e \`a passage tr\`es r\'eduits. Les r\'esultats montrent que les \'echangeurs de chaleur compacts optimis\'es pour l'utilisation de CO2 sont tr\'es comp\'etitifs par rapport aux \'echangeurs de r\'ef\'erence fonctionnant avec des HFC ou des HCFC, que ce soit du point de vue de l'encombrement, de la masse de l'\'echangeur et de la performance thermique. Par rapport aux installations fonctionnant avec le HFC-134a, on peut r\'eduire les dimensions de tube et de manifold. L'\'ecart de temp\'erature entre l'entr\'ee de l'air et la sortie de frigorig\`ene est beaucoup moins important dans les refroidisseurs \`a CO2 que dans les condenseurs de r\'ef\'erence, \`a encombrement et \`a compacit\'e \'equivalents; l'abaissement de la temp\'erature de sortie du frigorig\`ene a une grande influence sur le COP.

  abstract = {A steady state simulation model has been developed to evaluate the system performance of a transcritical carbon dioxide heat pump for simultaneous heating and cooling. The simulated results are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results reported in the literature. Such a system is suitable, for example, in dairy plants where simultaneous cooling at 4$^\circ$C and heating at 73$^\circ$C are required. The optimal COP was found to be a function of the compressor speed, the coolant inlet temperature to the evaporator and inlet temperature of the fluid to be heated in the gas cooler and compressor discharge pressure. An optimizing study for the best allocation of the fixed total heat exchanger inventory between the evaporator and the gas cooler based on the heat exchanger area has been carried out. Effect of heat transfer in the heat exchangers on system performance has been presented as well. Finally, a novel nomogram has been developed and it is expected to offer useful guidelines for system design and its optimisation.},

Investigation has done on two stainless steel circular tubes having inside-diameter of 4.55mm and 7.75mm and carried out for CO2 mass fluxes of 200\textendash{}600kg/m2s, inlet fluid pressures of 7.5\textendash{}10.0MPa, and the inlet fluid temperatures of 90\textendash{}100$^\circ$C. The experimental results indicate that the gas cooling pressure, the inner tube diameter, the mass flux and the temperature of CO2 have significant effects on the heat transfer coefficient, especially near pseudo-critical region. The heat transfer coefficient decreases as the cooling pressure increases otherwise increases as mass flux increases. At any temperatures, smaller inner tube diameter shows higher heat transfer coefficient. In comparison between present experimental data and existing correlations from references, most of supercritical heat transfer correlations show large deviations with this present experimental data. Therefore, based on experimental data obtained in this present work, a new correlation is proposed to predict more accurate heat transfer coefficient of supercritical CO2 in horizontal macro-tubes under cooling conditions. The majority of the experimental values are within 13\% of the values predicted by the new correlation.},

For in-tube condensation, it is found that the condensation HTCs for HFO-1234yf are inferior to those of R-134a, and the difference increases with the rise of vapor quality. The predictive correlations applicable for pressured drop for HFO-1234yf are not consistent, it is probably attributed to the difference in tube diameter in the publications.},

Variations of mass flow rate of refrigerant, compressor power, heating capacity, and co-efficient of performance (COP) with respect to the length of an internal heat exchanger are presented at various operating conditions. Good quantitative agreement between model predictions and experimental results has been found; most parameters have absolute average deviations of less than 4\%. As the length of the internal heat exchanger increases, COP is enhanced but heating capacity tends to decrease due to the trade-offs between the effectiveness and pressure drop in the internal heat exchanger.},

  abstract = {District energy systems can potentially decrease the CO2 emissions linked to energy services, thanks to the implementation of large polygeneration energy conversion technologies connected to buildings over a network. To transfer the energy from these large technologies to the users, conventional district energy systems use water with often two independent supply and return piping systems for heat and cold. However, sharing energy or interacting with decentralised heat pump units often results in relatively large heat transfer exergy losses due to the large temperature differences that are economically required from the water network. Besides, the implementation of two independent supply and return piping systems for heat and cold, results in large space requirements in underground technical galleries. Using refrigerants as a district heating or cooling fluid at an intermediate temperature could alleviate some of these drawbacks. A new system has been developed, that requires only two pipes, filled with refrigerant, to meet heating, hot water and cooling requirements. Because of the environmental concerns about conventional refrigerants, CO2, a natural refrigerant, used under its critical point, is considered an interesting candidate. A comparative analysis shows that both in terms of exergy efficiency and costs the proposed CO2 network is favourable.},

From the energy and exergy points of view, the results indicate that using heat exchanger reduces COP and exergy efficiency of the cycle with expander while the use of heat exchanger in the cycle with throttling valve enhances the COP and exergy efficiency.

  abstract = {Air-source transcritical CO2 heat pump systems have found attractive applications in automobile air conditioning, regional heating and commercial water heating systems. The coefficient of performance (COP) of such systems is affected by several operational variables, such as ambient temperatures, water outlet temperature, and discharge pressure. For practical operation, it is desirable to maintain the maximum achievable efficiency or COP of such systems in real time. However, performance of model based control/optimization strategies can be quite limited by the difficulty in acquiring accurate system models due to system nonlinearity, large variations in ambient conditions and thermal load, as well as equipment variation and degradation. In this study, a self-optimizing control scheme is proposed to maximize the COP in real time by using the extremum seeking control (ESC) strategy. ESC is a class of self-optimizing control strategy that can search for the unknown or slowly varying optimum input with respect to certain performance index, which is effectively a dynamic realization of the gradient search based on a dither-demodulation scheme. For the air-source transcritical CO2 heat-pump water heater, the discharge pressure setpoint is taken as the input to the ESC controller, while the system COP is taken as the performance index, i.e. the feedback signal for the extremum seeking process. To evaluate the proposed ESC strategy, a Modelica based dynamic simulation model is developed for the plant to perform the simulation study. Simulations are conducted for several scenarios: a fixed operation condition, change of the water outlet temperature setpoint, change of ambient condition, and changes of both the ambient temperature and water outlet temperature setpoint. For all simulation cases, the water inlet temperature is fixed at 12$^\circ$C, the ambient temperature is assumed to range from -15$^\circ$C to -35$^\circ$C, while the water outlet temperature ranges from 55$^\circ$C to 80$^\circ$C. Simulation results show that ESC is able to search and even track both fixed and slowly varying optimum COP without need for system model. Significant recovery of energy efficiency can thus be obtained for practical operation of such systems in a nearly model-free fashion.},

The influence of the regeneration is noticeable, however the simulation of the long term operation of a hypothetical variant without regeneration induces only a limited efficiency decrease and can also be considered as sustainable. The optimization results showed that the self consumption of electricity produced on site can be significantly improved by adapting the heat pump production profile with the electricity production; this was achieved through judicious management of the storage tanks. The analysis of the different level of parameter integration in the optimization model revealed that the optimization results are sensitive to the level of precision of the parameters. The iterative process allowed to combine the strengths of both modelling methods: the simulation was used to precisely describe the systems behaviour. Operational profiles from optimization were subsequently used in the simulation. The outcome of this process helped to better understand the system, identify optimal operating strategies while considering system limitations, as well as presenting a work on the comparison and iterative use of optimization and simulation.},

  abstract = {In the design of a ground-source heat pump (GSHP) system, the heat transfer from the fluid to the ground is influenced by the thermal borehole resistance between the fluid and the borehole surface and also by the interference resistance between the two (or four) pipes inside the borehole. Several authors have proposed empirical and theoretical relations to evaluate these resistances as well as methods to evaluate them experimentally. The paper compares the different approaches and proposes good practice to evaluate the resistances. The impact of the different approaches on the design of heat exchanger is also examined. Two-dimensional and fully three-dimensional numerical simulations are used to evaluate the different methods. A new method is also proposed to evaluate the borehole resistances from in situ tests.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.energy.2018.05.083},
  abstract = {The concept of urban CO2 networks has been developed to deploy heat pump based district heating and cooling systems in dense urban areas. The use of the CO2 phase change reduces the cost of the heat distribution while allowing to recover waste heat that is typically rejected to the environment. The use of heat pumps to harvest heat from the environment and to supply heat to buildings allows one to propose district systems with COP as high as 6. Heat pumps can use the electricity produced by photovoltaics already providing up to 60\% of the total consumption. This paper studies the integration of fuel cell based power to gas for the seasonal storage of the excess electricity produced in the summer by PV panels. The methane stored in liquid form is used in the winter to balance the electrical needs by fuel cell based cogeneration, making therefore the city 100\% supplied by renewable energy. The present work evaluates the integration of CO2 district energy network including power to gas systems on a compact urban block considering heating, cooling, electricity, e-mobility and waste management for different European climatic zones. In order to reach fully autonomous blocks using solar PV and municipal and industrial waste heat, a PV area of 10e35 m2/cap would be needed. The rooftop area available appears to be sufficient in areas like Southern Europe, while more area or alternative renewable sources such as wind or hydro are needed for other climatic zones. Regarding the economic feasibility of the system, the results show that an investment of 900e1300 V/cap would be needed, with a payback time between 11 and 14 years, depending on the different climate zones in Europe.},

  title = {Dynamic {{Modeling}} and {{Simulation}} of {{Two}}-Phase {{Evaporators}} and {{Condensers}} in the Context of a {{CO2 Based District Energy Network}}},
  abstract = {A new type of district energy network has recently been proposed that is based on the use of CO2 as a heat transfer fluid. It uses the latent heat of vaporization, instead of sensible heat, to store and transfer heat. Previous studies have focused on demonstrating the potential of such a network in terms of energy efficiency and economy. In order to assess the technical feasibility of such a network, and to address some of the safety related issues, an analysis of the network's dynamics is required. Such an analysis requires models to be developed for the network's central plant, heating users' substations, cooling users' substations, as well as for the piping. Moreover these dynamic models should be developed in such a way that they can be calibrated with the help of a future experimental setup. In this context a dynamic model of a plate evaporator (also useable as a plate condenser) is presented, it is based on a one dimensional local formulation of the conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy. In this formulation, mass and energy in the components are allowed to vary, while non stationary terms in the momentum equation are neglected. On the water side, frictional pressure drops are computed with Churchill equation while heat transfer coefficient is computed with Gnielinski's correlation. On the refrigerant side, a constant friction factor was implemented, while heat transfer coefficient is set to a reference value at reference conditions of mass flux and pressure. Variations of the heat transfer coefficient due to changes with respect to these two conditions are handled with exponents. These values are to be calibrated experimentally in a future work. The thermal capacity due to the mass of construction material was also accounted for in the model. In order to select an appropriate control scheme to be used in the experimental facility and, later on in a real network, the behavior of a cooling user substation including a control valve and an evaporator is discussed. A proportional integral controller showed its ability to stabilize the system to a desired degree of superheat at the evaporator outlet. Finally, perturbation rejection tests were made, and showed the ability of the system to operate under changing conditions of CO2 pressure and inlet enthalpy, as well as changes in the water mass flowrate, and inlet enthalpy.},

UESP being a highly multisectoral and multi-actor task, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are frequently used in the decision processes. These methods may provide support in organizing and identifying solutions to problems with conflicting objectives. However, knowing which method to use is generally not straightforward, as the appropriateness of a method or combination of methods depends on the decision problem's context. Therefore, this article reviewed scientific papers to characterize and analyze MCDA problems and methods in the context of UESP. The review systematically explores issues such as the scope of the problems, the alternatives and criteria considered, the expected decision outcomes, the decision analysis methods and the rationales for selecting and combining them, and the role of values in driving the decision problems. The final outcome is a synthesis of the data and insights obtained, which may help potential users identify appropriate decision analysis methods based on given problem characteristics.},
